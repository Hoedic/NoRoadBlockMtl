NoRoadBlockMtl

For the moment very basic structure:
- 	readworks.php: read the data source from montreal website and insert all the road blocks.
	For the moment, it does a stupid insert, and DB has few limitation, so if script is executed twice, points will be inserted twice...

-	index.php: displays a google maps + form to select the route/path + send path points to page postme.php
	To use the form : 	1. Select enter a start and end point and click "Tracer trajet" => this will print the path
								2. Enter a distance (it's in kilometers) and click on "Valider trajet" to send the path to the postme.php page
								
-	postme.php: read the form variable and queries the DB to retrieve and prints points with the entered distance of the selected path

-	config.php: contains the configuration to connect to the PostgreSQL DB (config.php.template should be renamed as config.php and values should be filled)

------
Setup of the DB

The code works with the folliwing DB structure :

Definition of the table (SQL)

CREATE TABLE "points_chantier" (
    "id" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "name" varchar(500) NOT NULL,
    "where" text NOT NULL,
    "raw_description" text NOT NULL
);


--------
Creation of the PostGIS parameters

SELECT AddGeometryColumn('points_chantier', 'point', 4326, 'LINESTRING', 2);
ALTER TABLE "points_chantier" ALTER "point" SET NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX "points_chantier_point_id" ON "points_chantier" USING GIST ( "point" GIST_GEOMETRY_OPS );

Note: initially my DB was created with a 'POINT' as the fourth parameter of the AddGeometryColumn.
However the city started using LINESTRING to mark roadworks. In my DB I just removed the POINT constrains.
But here, I set LINESTRING as the type of geometry.
